# Burger-Madness

This is a web app made using node, express, handlebars.js, mySQL, and deployed to heroku, where the user can add their own burgers to the available menu, then also choose which burgers to eat, which will move them to the "Devoured Burgers" column. 

The database is persistent, so you will see any burger any other user has created, or decided to eat.
